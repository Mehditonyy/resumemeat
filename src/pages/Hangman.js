  return <h1>Game Project: Culinary Cipher Challenge

  Embark on an intriguing JavaScript game inspired by Hangman, where players venture to decipher words associated with delectable food and beverages within a tight three-strike limit. This interactive gaming experience employs prompts for user engagement, revealing a randomly selected word from a curated list and offering a glimpse of certain initial letters. Users strategically guess letters to unveil the concealed word, with the ultimate goal of solving it before exhausting their limited attempts.
  
  Following each exhilarating round, the playAgain() function, utilizing the power of recursion, prompts users to make the pivotal decision to either continue their culinary exploration or gracefully exit the game. Opting for another round triggers the start() function, seamlessly initiating a fresh game with a new tantalizing word, ensuring an endless cycle of gameplay until the user decides to savor victory or gracefully conclude their culinary escapade.</h1>
